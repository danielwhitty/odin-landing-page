# odin-landing-page

## Purpose of the project
This project was undertaken in order to get comfortable with laying out a webpage given a template.

## Tools used
As far as layout is concerned, I primarily used flexbox after finding the power of this during the prior lessons.

## Purpose achieved?
Absolutely.
This definitely hit a sweet spot with my HTML and CSS abilities prior to the lesson, and was challenging enough to encourage plenty of extra digging to track down the correct way to finish off.
I'm incredibly happy with the projects presented by the Odin Project thus far, and can't wait to get cracking on some Javascript with the HTML and CSS fundamentals behind me.
